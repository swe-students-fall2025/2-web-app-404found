# Web Application Exercise

A little exercise to build a web application following an agile development process. See the [instructions](instructions.md) for more detail.

## Product vision statement

Our vision is to build an interactive and inclusive Job Forum web application where students and professionals can discover job opportunities, share experiences, and connect through posts and comments

## User stories

### As a visitor:
- I want to browse available job listings so that I can learn about open opportunities.

### As a user:
- I want to search job posts by keyword, location, or company so that I can quickly find relevant openings.
- I want to comment under posts so that I can discuss or ask questions.
- I want to delete my own comments so that I can manage my interactions responsibly.

### As an admin:
- I want to review and remove inappropriate content so that the community stays professional and safe.
